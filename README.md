## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-parser-crud-api.git
cd file-parser-crud-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install flask llama-index-core
```

**About LlamaIndex:**
LlamaIndex is a powerful data framework designed to help you build applications with large language models (LLMs). In this project, we use:
- `SimpleDirectoryReader` - For intelligent document loading and parsing
- Supports multiple file formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, HTML, and more
- Automatically extracts text content and metadata from documents
- Provides structured document chunking for better content organization

### 3. Configure Upload Directory
Update the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` path in the code to match your system:
```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'C:/Users/kowsh/OneDrive/Desktop/NITRO'  # Update this path
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage Examples

### Upload a File
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5000/files \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
